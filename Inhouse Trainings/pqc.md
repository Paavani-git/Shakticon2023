### Post quantum computers

#### Grover's algo:
* This is to olve square root problem
* It works with keylength of 256 which can give the complexity of 128 for aes 256.It helps in improving brute force attack.

#### Shor's algorithm:
* It is used to solve DLP and integer factorization problem in polynomial time on computer.
* It solves hidden sub group problems.
